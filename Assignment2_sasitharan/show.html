						Unlike most television crime dramas, which neatly introduce and then solve a
						case all in the space of one hour, HBO's THE WIRE follows one single drug and
						homicide investigation throughout the length of an entire season. Centered on
						the drug culture of inner-city Baltimore, the series' storyline unfolds from the points of
						view of both the criminals lording the streets and the police officers determined to bring them down.
